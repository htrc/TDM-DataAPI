## Secret key
# http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret

## Modules
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Modules
# ~~~~~
# Control which modules are loaded when Play starts.  Note that modules are
# the replacement for "GlobalSettings", which are deprecated in 2.5.x.
# Please see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/GlobalSettings
# for more information.
#
# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory
play.modules {
    # By default, Play will load any class called Module that is defined
    # in the root package (the "app" directory), or you can define them
    # explicitly below.
    # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
    #enabled += my.application.Module

    enabled += "play.modules.reactivemongo.ReactiveMongoModule"

    # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
    #disabled += ""
}

# directly to the code location in the IDE in dev mode. The following line makes
# use of the IntelliJ IDEA REST interface:
play.editor="http://localhost:63342/api/file/?file=%s&line=%s"
